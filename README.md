# Genie

An inference engine written 100% in Elixir.

**Important**: The API is highly unstable right now. If you want a more stable solution you should look
somewhere else right now or wait until the API is stable (version 1.0.0). 

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `genie` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:genie, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
